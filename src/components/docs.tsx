            </strong>Formula 1 is one of the most prestigious and challenging motorsports that attracts millions of
                fans worldwide. Predicting the winner of the next Grand Prix race is challenging and requires a
                comprehensive understanding of various factors. Several studies have been conducted to predict the race's winner, but most were based on subjective opinions and lacked data-driven approaches. We propose a machine learning approach to predict the following Formula 1 Grand
                Prix race winner. Our approach considers various factors like weather conditions, driver and
                constructor standings, qualifying results, race results, and many more, both present and past.
                This is buried deep in many datasets requiring much analysis to merge. We will analyze the datasets and apply regression and classification techniques to predict the race winners. We will also evaluate the performance of our approach using various evaluation metrics and achieve promising results.</p><p id="67439476-974c-4145-92d7-89a227839432" >

                The primary objective of this paper is to propose a machine-learning approach to predict the winner of the following Formula 1 Grand Prix race. We aim to provide an accurate prediction that considers various present and past factors to help fans, team managers, and betters make informed decisions. We aim to do robust data analysis and find the factors contributing towards winners while also predicting the band of winners

                Our approach is based on machine learning and considers various present and past factors to
                predict the winner of the next Grand Prix race. We have used publicly available datasets and
                applied regression and classification techniques to predict the bands of winners. Based on our approach we will draw out inferences on major statistics and major winning factors. Our approach can be applied to any Formula 1 race and can be helpful for fans, team managers, and betters in

                The proposed approach can have a significant impact on the Formula 1 industry. It can give fans
                accurate predictions of the race winners and enhance their viewing experience. Team managers
                can use the predictions to devise their race strategies and make informed decisions. Betters can
                use the predictions to place their bets on the race winner and increase their chances of winning.

Our goal was to compare the performance of different models and select the best one for our final predictions.</p><p id="1c58e2c0-a902-431b-9aa6-16eec683485a" >The models we trained were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. We chose these models based on their popularity in the machine learning community and their ability to handle classification problems.</p><p id="6f581fd6-0414-47c3-9559-5744e6545ae2" >We also employed cross-validation as part of our methodology to evaluate the performance of our models. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model can generalize to new data. It involves partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets, training the model on the training set, and then evaluating its performance on the validation set. This process is repeated several times, with different partitions of the data, to obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. We used k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k equally-sized subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. Cross-validation allowed us to assess the performance of our models on different subsets of the data and to fine-tune the hyperparameters to avoid overfitting.</p><p id="b993b05f-f5e0-486f-a3e2-9fe8db12fe0e" >To train the models, we used a range of parameters that were selected after thorough research and experimentation. For example, for the Decision Tree model, we used the "entropy" criterion to measure the quality of a split and "max_depth" to limit the depth of the tree to avoid overfitting. For the Random Forest model, we used "n_estimators" to control the number of trees in the forest and "max_features" to limit the number of features considered for each split. We also used cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each model and fine-tune the parameters.</p><p id="1bc0a876-8dfe-419a-ad72-8571d5ccb5f1" >After training and evaluating the models, we selected the Random Forest model as our final model, as it showed the highest accuracy. The Random Forest model also provided feature importance scores, which allowed us to identify the most important features for predicting driver performance.</p><p id="205a5318-e868-411e-b1cb-a6618cac5d2e" >Overall, our methodology involved thorough research and experimentation to select and train the best models, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize their performance. We also used feature engineering as a part of  creating some intermediate columns based on our analysis of the data, such as "driver confidence," which was calculated as the percentage of races a driver had completed without a DNF. We also created columns to capture the home advantage of drivers and constructors, as well as their relative reliability compared to other drivers and constructors. We also used selection techniques to identify the most important features and improve the accuracy of our predictions.</p><h3 id="1e32ccba-2757-4f19-a895-52e45f36c1b3" >Novelty:</h3><p id="f8add1d3-1a0b-42fa-adc3-7e23994f1461" >Our project is unique in that it applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict driver performance in Formula One races. While motorsports are often subject to human intuition and subjective opinions, our project takes a data-driven approach to predicting outcomes, using a variety of factors that contribute to driver and constructor success. We also introduced novel features, such as driver and constructor confidence, and home team effects and also DNF ratios and DNF index for drivers and constructors which allowed us to better capture the nuances of motorsport performance. Our project offers a new perspective on motorsports analytics and could have important applications in areas such as sports betting, team management, and driver development. Overall, our project represents a significant contribution to the field of motorsport analytics and showcases the potential of data-driven approaches in predicting and understanding motorsport performance.</p><h3 id="bcd05d23-3754-45a0-8261-a1ca037ad601" >Application:</h3><p id="163e2590-5665-471c-992f-37aba80a03ba" > By using data-driven models to predict the likelihood of a driver finishing in the podium or points positions, or having a DNF, our project could help bettors make more informed decisions and improve their chances of winning.</p><p id="12447963-740e-4b60-a8f5-2c7fd38f3e47" >Another application of our project is in team management, where our predictions could help teams make strategic decisions on factors such as driver selection, race strategy, and car development.

Using our machine learning model to predict race outcomes, we can select the top-performing drivers and constructors within the constraints of a limited budget, maximizing the chances of scoring the most points in a fantasy league. This application of our model could be of interest to F1 enthusiasts who participate in fantasy leagues, providing a unique and data-driven approach to building a winning team.</p><p id="f71230fc-24a2-49b3-b940-a264fd1632ba" >Our project could also have applications in driver development, where our predictions could be used to identify talented drivers and provide insights into the factors that contribute to their success.

We had unnecessarily taken up a lot of variables which we thought would influence our race outcomes although yes they would be affecting the race outcomes, they were making an insignificant impact on the race outcomes. We then employed several feature engineering techniques, such as driver and constructor confidence, home team advantage, and DNF rate, to improve the accuracy of our models. Furthermore, we performed feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to further improve the performance of our models.</p><p id="8a2b9b65-eca8-4dd4-9814-135d2fea1dc1" >After these improvements, we observed a substantial increase in accuracy across all models. The SVC algorithm yielded the highest accuracy of 0.95, followed by the Random Forest Classifier at 0.94.
